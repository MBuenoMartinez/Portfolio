      "As a Front end Developer, I was in charge of developing the client-side of the page. My job was to provide functionality to various components of the page and establish connections with the server-side. Indirectly, I took on the role of a leader in the front-end development team, so in addition to my assigned tasks, I also assisted my colleagues when they needed help. I also acted as the bridge between the server and the client to connect both worlds, so I not only worked as a front-end developer but also contributed ideas and solutions as a back-end developer. During the process, I learned to use agile methodologies, specifically the Scrum method. This project helped enhance my competence in teamwork and communication.",
