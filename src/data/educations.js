    description:
      "In this course, I learned about what a programming language entails. Over the course of four months, we focused on learning JavaScript, React, Redux, Sequelize, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. In the initial months, we delved into the theory, complemented by practical exercises. Additionally, we executed a comprehensive project with the theme of Rick and Morty to solidify the new knowledge acquired throughout the classes. These first two months constituted the initial part of the boot camp.The last months were dedicated to the practical projects phase (laps), which involved completing two projects: an individual project and a group project. For the individual project, I developed an application with the theme of Formula 1 racers.  In the group project, we built a website from scratch, opting for an e-commerce platform focused on reducing environmental impact. Both projects are available in the 'My Projects' section of this portfolio.",
